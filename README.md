# mypy.app

This is a webapp which allows you to run mypy code in the browser for experimentation.

Eventually, the hope is to support multiple versions of mypy.

For now the main features are:

- entirely client-side type-checking
- ability to install pure-Python packages (e.g. types-\* packages)
- pass arbitrary command line flags
- color output
- ability to share snippets with command line flags and installed packages
